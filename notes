language codes are in ISO 639-1 since that's what wikipedia seems to be using

Getting data from an english language dictionary seems to skew the words to french/latin patterns. There are lots of less common words with romantic origin, while germanic stuff tends to be used very often, but that's not reflected in a flat wordlist.

This program will technically work on logographic languges like Chinese, but it will only produce meaningful data for syllabic languages.


I highly recommend the unicode dictionaries from http://www.winedt.org/Dict/
Although you have to go through and pull all the text onto one line
